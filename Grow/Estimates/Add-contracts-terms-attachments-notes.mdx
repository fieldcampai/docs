A well-prepared estimate does more than just list prices-it builds trust, clarifies expectations, and protects your business. In FieldCamp, you can enhance every estimate by attaching contracts, specifying terms and conditions, including supporting documents, and adding internal or client-facing notes. This guide will walk you through each of these features and show you how to use them to deliver clear, professional, and comprehensive estimates.

## 1. Attaching a Contract

### Why Attach a Contract?

Contracts formalize the agreement between you and your client, outlining the scope of work, responsibilities, deliverables, and legal obligations. Attaching a contract to your estimate keeps all relevant documents together, making it easy for both parties to reference and agree on the terms before work begins.

### How to Attach a Contract in FieldCamp:

- In the estimate creation or editing screen, look for the Contract section.
- Click Attach a Contract.
- Select an existing contract from your library or upload a new one.
- The contract will now be linked to this estimate, ensuring all parties have access to the agreed terms.

## 2. Adding Terms & Conditions

### **Why Add Terms & Conditions?**

Terms and conditions clarify the rules of engagement for each job. They can include payment terms, cancellation policies, warranties, liability clauses, and any other legal or operational details specific to the estimate or client.

### How to Add Terms & Conditions:

- In the estimate form, find the Terms & Conditions section.
- Enter your standard terms, or customize them for the specific job or client.
- Be clear and concise to avoid misunderstandings.
- These terms will be visible to your client when they review the estimate.

<Tip>
  Review and update your terms regularly to reflect changes in your business policies or legal requirements.

## 3. Including Attachments

### **Why Include Attachments?**

Supporting documents such as images, blueprints, certifications, or product datasheets provide extra detail, transparency, and credibility to your estimate. They help clients visualize the work, understand the scope, and make informed decisions.

## 4. Adding Notes

### **Why Use Notes?**

Notes are a flexible way to add extra information to your estimate. You can use them to provide special instructions for the client, highlight important details, or leave internal messages for your team.

### How to Add Notes in FieldCamp:

- In the Notes section of the estimate form, type any relevant information.
- Specify whether the note is for the client (visible on the estimate) or for internal use only.
- Internal notes help your team stay aligned, while client-facing notes can clarify unique job details or requirements.
