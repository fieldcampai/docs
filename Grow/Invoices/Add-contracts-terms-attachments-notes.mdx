A well-prepared invoice does more than request payment-it builds trust, clarifies expectations, and protects your business. In FieldCamp, you can enhance every invoice by attaching contracts, specifying terms and conditions, including supporting documents, and adding internal or client-facing notes. This guide will walk you through each of these features and show you how to use them to deliver clear, professional, and comprehensive invoices.

## **1. Attaching a Contract**

### Why Attach a Contract?

Contracts formalize the agreement between you and your client, outlining the scope of work, responsibilities, deliverables, and payment obligations. Attaching a contract to your invoice keeps all relevant documents together, making it easy for both parties to reference and agree on the terms after the work is complete.

## **2. Adding Terms & Conditions**

### Why Add Terms & Conditions?

Terms and conditions clarify the payment rules and expectations for each job. They can include payment terms, late fees, warranties, liability clauses, or any other legal or operational details specific to the invoice or client.

## **3. Including Attachments**

### Why Include Attachments?

Supporting documents such as images, receipts, certifications, or signed work orders provide extra detail, transparency, and credibility to your invoice. They help clients understand the charges, verify completed work, and make informed payments.

Notes are a flexible way to add extra information to your invoice. Use them to provide special instructions for the client, highlight important details, or leave internal messages for your team.
