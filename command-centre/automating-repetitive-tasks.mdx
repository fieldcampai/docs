FieldCamp’s **AI-powered chat interface**, known as the **Command Centre**, simplifies repetitive tasks by allowing users to perform actions through **natural language commands**. Instead of manually navigating menus, users can quickly complete tasks like scheduling jobs, adding clients, or updating service details directly within the chat interface. This automation saves time, ensures accuracy, and enables users to focus on higher-value work.

## Steps to Automate Tasks Using the Command Centre

### 1. Initiate a Task Using Natural Language

* **Start with a Simple Command**: Type your request in plain language. Examples:

  * **“Add a new client named John Doe with email** [**john@example.com**]()**.”**

  * **“Schedule a job for window cleaning tomorrow at 10 AM.”**

  * **“Update the price of Air Conditioner Repair to $200.”**

* **Send the Command**: Press "Enter" or click the **Send** button.

### 2. AI Processes Your Command

* **AI Response**: The system interprets your input, confirms the action, and provides feedback:

  * Example: *“Client John Doe has been added successfully.”*

* **Prompt for Missing Information**: If additional details are required, the AI will ask follow-up questions:

  * Example: *“What is John Doe’s phone number?”*

### 3. Review and Confirm the Action

* **Confirmation**: The system displays a summary of the completed task for verification.

  * Example: *“The price for Air Conditioner Repair has been updated to $200.”*

* **Edit If Necessary**: If there’s an error, provide additional corrections or details directly in the chat.

### 4. Slash Commands in Command Centre

* **Use Slash (/) Commands**: Perform specific tasks quickly using predefined shortcuts.

* **Task Management**:

  * Example: **`/task Can you remind me every year on 1st Jan to wish FieldCamp a happy birthday?`**

* **Analytics & Reporting**:

  * Example: **`/analytics Show me last month’s job completion rate.`**

* **User Actions**:

  * Example: **`/user Add a new team member named Alice with email `**[**`alice@example.com`**](mailto:alice@example.com)**`.`**

* **Scheduling & Reminders**:

  * Example: **`/schedule Create a follow-up meeting for client John Doe on Friday at 3 PM.`**

## Benefits of Using the Command Centre

* **Time-Saving**: Eliminate manual navigation by performing tasks instantly.

* **Increased Accuracy**: Reduce errors through AI-assisted confirmations and clarifications.
