- The system then **auto-generates an optimized travel route** for each technician. 

<Tip>
  Optimizing routes helps reduce technician travel time, allowing more jobs to be completed in a day. 
</Tip>

**Step 4: Generate and Share the Optimized Route URL** 

- After route optimization is complete, FieldCamp **creates a unique shareable URL** containing the optimized route.  You can find the **'Share URL'** option at the **top right corner** of the screen.

- Technicians can open the link on their mobile device and follow the **pre-determined route** using their preferred navigation app (Google Maps, Waze, etc.). 
- This eliminates the need for manual route planning and ensures a streamlined workflow. 

<Tip>
  Review daily schedules at the start of the day to ensure no jobs are left unassigned. 
</Tip>

FieldCamp’s **route optimization feature** provides a **simple yet highly effective** solution for improving field service efficiency. Instead of relying on manual scheduling, businesses can automatically generate the best travel routes and share them with technicians via a single URL.
