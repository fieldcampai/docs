1. When adding or editing an inventory item, set a **Low Stock Alert Threshold** (e.g., 5 units).Â 
2. When the stock drops below this threshold, the system will automatically:Â 

- Highlight the item in **red** to indicate low stock.Â 
- Display a **Low Stock Alert** on the dashboard.Â 

  Use this alert to restock items **before they run out**, preventing delays in jobÂ execution.Â

  Review stock alerts regularly to keep essential supplies in check.Â
