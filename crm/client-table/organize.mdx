The **Client Table** in FieldCamp enables users to **sort, filter, and organize** client records efficiently. Sorting arranges data (e.g., by name or contact date), filtering narrows results (e.g., by location or status), and organizing allows you to **group and customize** the display to focus on relevant details.

## Steps for Sorting, Filtering, and Organizing Clients

### 1. Access the Client Table

* Navigate to the **Clients** section from the main menu.

* The Client Table will display a list of all stored client records.

## Using the Organize Button

* The **Organize** button at the top-right of the Client Table provides access to multiple customization options in one place.

* Clicking on **Organize** allows you to:

<Tip>
  - **Filter** records based on location, status, or date range.

  - **Sort By** different fields such as Name, Last Contacted, or Email.

  - **Group By** specific attributes like status or industry.

  - **Customize Columns** by selecting which fields to display.

  - **Adjust Pagination** or enable infinite scroll for easier navigation.

  - **Manage Properties** to add or edit custom properties for clients.
</Tip>

## Sorting Clients

Sorting can be done in two ways:

* **From Column Headers**: Locate **Column Headers** at the top of the Client Table, such as:

  * **Name**

  * **Email**

  * **Last Contacted**

  * **Location**

* Click a column header to **sort clients** in ascending or descending order.

  * Example: Clicking **Name** arranges clients alphabetically (A-Z or Z-A).

* **From Organize Menu**: Click **Organize > Sort By**, select a column, and define sorting conditions.

## Filtering Clients

* Open the **Filter** menu by clicking the **“Filter”** button or access it through **Organize**.

* Set filter criteria such as:

  * **Location**: Filter clients by city, state, or region.

  * **Status**: Show only active, inactive, or priority clients.

  * **Date Range**: Display clients contacted or added within a specific timeframe.

* Click **Apply** to update the table and show only relevant records.

## Organizing Clients

* **Select Columns to Display**:

  * Click the **“Customize Columns”** button inside **Organize** to choose which fields appear in the table.

  * Example: Display only **Name, Email, and Phone Number**.

* **Rearrange Columns**:

  * Drag and drop column headers to change their order.

* **Group by Category (If Supported)**:

  * Use the **“Group By”** option inside **Organize** to categorize clients by attributes like **status** or **location**.

## Pagination & Infinite Scroll

* **Manage Pagination**:

  * Adjust the number of records displayed per page for easy navigation.

* **Enable Infinite Scroll (If Available)**:

  * Load more records as you scroll instead of using pagination.

## Adding Custom Properties

* **Define Custom Fields**:

  * Open **Organize > Properties**.

  * Add new fields such as **Industry, Payment Terms, or VIP Status**.

* **Apply to Clients**:

  * When adding or editing a client, enter values for custom properties.

### 5. Save and Access Custom Views
