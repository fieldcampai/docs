The Pipeline Management feature allows you to track and manage your clients through different stages, ensuring a smooth transition from lead acquisition to client retention. The feature includes three primary sections: **Leads, Pipeline, and Clients**, with different stages that define their progress. You can view the data in either a **table view** or a **Kanban view** for better visualization.

# **Leads**  

The **Leads** section is where potential clients are first added. Leads go through different stages before they qualify for the **Pipeline** section. The available lead stages are: 

- **New Lead**: A fresh lead that has been added to the system. 
- **Contacted**: The lead has been reached out to. 
- **Qualified**: The lead has shown interest and is now ready to move to the pipeline.
