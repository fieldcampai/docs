Managing a field service business means juggling multiple modulesâ€”Clients, Jobs, Calendar, Inventory, and more. FieldCampâ€™s **My Views** feature helps you stay focused by letting you customize which modules are front and center in your workspace.

## **What are My Views?**

The **My Views** panel acts as your personalized launchpad. It lets you:

- Pin the modules you use most frequently
- Discover other available tools
- Create a focused workspace tailored to your daily workflow

Instead of navigating through menus, you can jump directly into what matters.

## **Exploring the My Views Window**

When you open **My Views**, you'll see a grid of available FieldCamp modules such as:

- Inbox
- Clients
- Sales Pipeline
- Calendar
- Jobs
- Products & Services
- Inventory Management
- Analytics

Each tile shows the module name, its section label, and aÂ  pin icon for favorites.

## **How to Pin or Unpin a View**

1. Hover over any module tile
2. Click the **ðŸ“Œ pin icon** in the top-right corner
3. Pinned modules will appear in your sidebar or top menu for quick access

To unpin a module, click the pin icon again.

With My Views, FieldCamp becomes your dashboardâ€”not just a workspace. Pin what matters, and skip the rest.
