FieldCamp’s Workflow Builder is a powerful automation tool that helps you define _“if this, then that”_ logic for your business processes—without writing a single line of code. Whether you're sending reminders, assigning tasks, or following up with clients, workflows put your operations on autopilot.

## **What is the Workflow Builder?**

The Workflow Builder is a **visual automation tool** that allows you to set up custom logic using **triggers, conditions, and actions**. Think of it as a drag-and-drop canvas where you define what happens _when_ something occurs in your system.

## **Where to Find It**

You can access the **Workflow Builder** from the **Settings** menu in FieldCamp. Just head to **Settings → Workflow Builder ** to view, create, or edit automations.

### **Step 1: Viewing Your Workflows**

When you visit the **Workflows** page, you’ll see a list of all saved workflows:

- **Name**: The label you've given to each workflow
- **Trigger Type**: The event that starts the workflow (e.g., "On Schedule")
- **Module**: The module the workflow is tied to (e.g., Visits, Jobs, Clients)
- **Status**: Indicates if the workflow is active or paused
- **Created/Updated At**: Tracks when the workflow was created or last modified

### **Step 2: Building a New Workflow**

Once inside the builder:

- **Name your workflow** in the top bar (default is "Untitled Workflow")
- Use the controls:


- **Add Trigger**: Define the event that initiates the workflow (e.g., a new visit is scheduled)
- **Add Condition**: Set logical checks (e.g., visit type is “Repair”)
- **Add Action**: Choose what should happen (e.g., send SMS or assign technician)

The empty **grid canvas** is where you'll visually map out your automation flow. Each element you add appears as a node, and you can connect them in sequence to define the workflow.

### **Step 3: Save & Activate**

Once your flow is ready, click **Save**. You can return later to edit or toggle the status (Active/Inactive) as shown in the workflows list.
